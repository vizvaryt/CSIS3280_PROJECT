This is the GitHub repository for my CSIS3280 Project.
The project is a bookstore webapp  called "Bookmania" that utilizes PHP, mySQL, and many other technologies.
The project report/summary can be found in the wiki.
XAMPP is required to run the website locally.
Please execute the "scripts.SQL" file in mySQL in order to load the database required for the website.
There is a single pre-programmed user with the credentials “admin@admin.com” and “admin” as the password.
